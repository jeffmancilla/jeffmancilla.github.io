> I love building experiences with efficient UI and scalability in mind.

Through over a decade of previously experience in the higher education space, I've had the privilege of delivering many products and services:
- **CMDB**, IT **service catalog** and **asset management** through **ServiceNow** platform development
- **building websites** and maintaining web content while ensuring **web accessibility**
- **system administration**, **DevOps**, and leading technical pieces of *campus-wide initiatives*
- **IT service management**, running a service desk and *mentoring student employees*

I *love **video games***, and used to play them competitively. [You'll find me for a split second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUIEkRsuVDg&t=2635s) in a Street Fighter tournament documentary! I'm pretty washed now, but I'm always up for playing multiplayer games - versus or co-op! I just can't do all-day practice lab sessions like FGC folks used to (and still do).

I'm a serial hobbyist! Here's some of the things I do on the side:
- **cooking**: i love learning about specific skills: bread, pizza, pasta, demi-glace, and getting a great sear on meat with a tender and juicy doneness in the center. i like to peep the escoffier bible from time to time for ideas.
- **coffee**: San Francisco spoiled me with coffee. I love Verve, Andytown, Ritual and Sightglass to name a few. If you have recommendations around medium roast coffee that's roasted in Texas, I'd love to hear about it!
- **internet of things**: it all started with smart lights and consolidating IR-controlled devices with a Harmony Hub. Lately, it's been home security via Home Assistant on a Raspberry Pi4, but resources got tight pretty fast. I'll be looking into moving to Proxmox and maybe Docker on LXCs in the near future.
- **tinkering**: i've built arcade sticks, gaming PCs, headphone amplifiers, custom maps in video games and pretty much anything moddable
- **motorcycles**: i love to ride, and i deeply miss all-season riding in California. sadly, my tinkering makes it over to the bikes, and they end up in pieces about half of the time -_-
