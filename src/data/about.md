I love to build experiences with efficient UI and scalability in mind.

Previously in the higher education space with over ten years of experience in ServiceNow development, building web content, ensuring web accessibility, IT service management and system administration.

I'm a serial hobbyist! Here's some of the things I do on the side:
- cooking: i love learning about specific skills: bread, pizza, pasta, demi-glace, and getting a great sear on meat with a tender and juicy doneness in the center. i like to peep the escoffier bible from time to time for ideas.
- coffee: San Francisco spoiled me with coffee. I love Verve, Andytown, Ritual and Sightglass to name a few. If you have recommendations around medium roast coffee that's roasted in Texas, I'd love to hear about it!
- internet of things: it all started with getting a Logitech Harmony Hub and pairing all of my Hue lights and IR-controlled devices for automation and with IFTTT. Lately, I've been playing around with home security via Home Assistant on a RPi4, but things got slow pretty fast. I'll be looking into Proxmox and maybe Docker on LXCs in the near future.
- tinkering: i've built arcade sticks, gaming PCs, headphone amplifiers, you name it. 
- motorcycles: i love to ride, and i deeply miss all-season riding in California. sadly, my tinkering makes it over to my bikes and i end up not having a bike to ride for long periods of time -_-

I used to play video games competitively. [I appear for a split second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUIEkRsuVDg&t=2635s)(at the 44 minute mark) in a Street Fighter documentary. I'm washed now, but I'm always up for playing fighting games with others! I just can't do the 8 hour lab sessions like FGC folks used to (and still do).
